# FRC 2016
# Renegade!
We decided to take the code that was run at the 2016 championship and re-write the whole robot in a command-based format.  This is rather new to us, so your milleage may vary.
Since this is a re-architecture of our existing code base, we have omitted some functions including autonomous and vision.
